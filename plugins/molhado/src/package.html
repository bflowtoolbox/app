<BODY>
<p> This package and its subpackages contains the executable classes
making up the current implementation of the ACT/Fluid prototype.  This
package in particular contains very little, just a few exception
classes.  To learn more about the basic internal representation see
{@link fluid.ir}, {@link fluid.tree}, and
{@link fluid.version}.  Generic parsing and unparsing
classes live in the {@link fluid.parse} and
{@link fluid.unparse} packages respectively. The package
{@link fluid.control} contains classes for control-flow
graphs and analysis over them.  The package
{@link fluid.test} and its subpackages demonstrates some of
the generic capabilities in the context of a trivial language.
The package {@link fluid.java} implements the capabilities
for the Java programming language.  The package
{@link fluid.display} contains basic user-interface
classes.</p>
