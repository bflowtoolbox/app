<BODY>
<p>The classes in this package implement a versioning system on top of
the basic internal representation (IR) implemented in the
{@link fluid.ir} package.  Class in this package introduce
the concept of a ``version'' and a ``versioned slot'', whose value may
differ between versions. </p>


<h3>Versions</h3>

<p> A <em>version</em> is an abstraction of a point in time as
measured in modifications to <em>versioned slots</em>.  Such slots may
be changed in the manner of simple slots, and as long as no other
features of the versioning system are used, they behave in the much
the same way as simple (mutable) slots.  However, at any point, one
may query the current version.  Later, the state of the system can be
returned to this version.  All mutations of versioned slots are
conceptually rolled back to their values at this time.  The state of
the system can be restored to <em>any</em> version that was requested,
including ones that were left when restoring another version.  In
other words, the system keeps track of a tree of versions representing
multiple choices in ``time.''</p>

<p> As far as the client of the versioning system is aware, a new
version is created after every mutation of a versioned slot.  However,
internally, the system only creates new versions as needed.  Thus if
1000 mutations are performed and then the current version is
requested, the system will at that point ``freeze'' the current
version, which will be the first new version since before the
mutations.  This optimization enables the number of versions to be
dramatically curtailed. </p>

<p> The most important entries to the versioning system are:<ul>
<li> {@link fluid.version.Version#getVersion}
Gets the current version (and freezes it).
<li> {@link fluid.version.Version#setVersion}
Sets the current version to version argument.
If the change is only temporary, this call should be wrapped inside of
calls to the following two methods:
<li> {@link fluid.version.Version#saveVersion}
Saves the current version on a private stack without freezing it.
<li> {@link fluid.version.Version#restoreVersion}
Sets the current version to the latest saved version that has not yet
been restored.
</ul>
There are also methods to retrieve the initial version and to
determine the relationship between two versions.
See the {@link fluid.version.Version} class documentation.
</p>

<p> The ``current version'' may differ from thread to thread.
Internally, the current version is stored in a
{@link fluid.util.ThreadGlobal} variable.
The {@link fluid.version.Version#saveVersion} and
{@link fluid.version.Version#restoreVersion} methods are implemented using
{@link fluid.util.ThreadGlobal#pushValue} and
{@link fluid.util.ThreadGlobal#popValue} methods,
respectively.
As a result, while saves and restores within a single thread must be
properly nested, they needed not be nested between threads.
</p>

<p> The version tree can be viewed as a tree (technically as a {@link
fluid.tree.TreeInterface}).  Use {@link
fluid.version.Version#getShadowTree()} to get the tree.
The shadow node for a version can be obtained using
{@link fluid.version.Version#getShadowNode()} and the version for a
shadow node can be obtained using 
{@link fluid.version.Version#getShadowVersion(IRNode)}.  The latter
function will freeze the version.  If you use observers or listeners
to observe changes in the version shadow tree, be very careful that
you do not cause the current version to be frozen, or the number of
versions will rise dramatically.
</p>

<p> <strong>The following class and its functionality are
deprecated!</strong><br>
<blockquote>
The ``current version'' is conceptually updated whenever a
mutation occurs to point to the newly created version.  This concept
of an updateable version pointer is realized in the concept of a
<em>version cursor</em>.  A version cursor refers to a particular
version and is updated whenever this version is current and a mutation
happens (thus creating a new version).  One may think of a version
cursor as a growing tip on the version tree.  The method
{@link fluid.version.VersionCursor#VersionCursor()} retrieves a
cursor for the current version.
See the class documentation for {@link fluid.version.VersionCursor} for more
information.
</blockquote>
</p> 

<h3>Versioned Slots</h3>

<p> A mutable slot may be created that differs from version to
version.  Such a slot is called a <em>versioned slot</em>.  
A versioned slot may have an <em>initial value</em>, that is a value
for the initial version (see {@link
fluid.version.Version#getInitialVersion}).
In previous instances of the Fluid IR, this initial value could be set
by using ordinary mutation: an undefined slot would be defined in this
manner.  This led to several technical and semantic difficulties and
so the initial value can only be set on creation (or when reading IR
from persistent store).
</p>
<p>
As mentioned previously, every change in a versioned slot essentially
creates a new version of the system.  Internally, we first call 
{@link fluid.version.Version#bumpVersion()} which creates a new
version child of the current version unless the current version is
unknown (having never been requested by a client).  Then, we tell the
versioned slot to save a new <i>(version,value)</i> pair.  When the
value is requested, the current version is used to find the assignment
for the nearest ancestor version.  There is no way to remove a pair.
</p>

<p> 
As with simple and constant slots,
versioned slots come individually, or can be packaged in attributes
(slot infos) or sequences (both arrays and lists).
The factory for versioned slots
{@link fluid.version.VersionedSlotFactory} should be used to create versioned
slots, attributes (which may either be predefined or undefined) or
sequences.
If you use <code>new
IRList(VersionedSlotFactory.prototype,0)</code> instead of 
<code>VersionedSlotFactory.prototype.newSequence(~0)</code>
you will get an inefficient representation.  Similarly for attributes.
</p>

<p> A derived attribute which is expensive to compute and which depends
upon versioned information may be conveniently declared as a subclass
of {@link fluid.version.MemoedSlotInfo}.  Instances of this class keep track
of all computed values indexed by node and by version.  The table can
be cleared on demand to release space.
</p>

<p> A special kind of versioned slot used in
{@link fluid.version.VersionedUnitSlotInfo} does not hold values, but instead
simply records when it is set.  If an instance of this class is set
whenever a change of a particular sort is performed to a node, then it
can be used to determine whether two versions differ for the node with
respect to the changes.  See the class documentation for more
information.  This class is used to implement change bits on abstract
syntax trees; see {@link fluid.version.TreeChanged}.  
</p>

<h3>Persistence</h3>

<p> Versions are defined in terms of their {@link fluid.version.Era}:
a forest of version subtrees sharing a single version root outside the
era.  An Era keeps track of all versioned chunks that are assigned for
versions in the era.  Individual versions cannot be saved except in
relation to a saved era.
</p>

<p> Versioned slots can be saved and restored, usually in the form of
versioned chunks (see {@link fluid.version.VersionedChunk}).
One may save deltas (VCDs) or snapshots (VCS).  Snapshots save all the
information at a particular version and can be large.  Deltas save
only the changed information and can only be loaded if a delta or
snapshot is already loaded for the root version of an era.
</p>

<p> If a value of a versioned slot is requested for a version whose
chunk or snapshot has not yet been loaded, the system throws an
{@link fluid.ir.SlotUnknownException} exception.
