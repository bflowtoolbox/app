<BODY>
<p> This package includes classes for building control-flow graphs.
While the basics were designed with Java in mind, the classes here are
not specific to Java.  Java-specific additions to the classes are
defined in {@link fluid.java.control} and in specific
operator files in {@link fluid.java.operator}.  Java
specific analyses using these nodes are defined in
{@link fluid.java.analysis}</p>

<h2>The Control-Flow Graph (CFG)</h2>

<p> The control-flow graph is built with explicit nodes and edges
and can be traversed in either direction.  (The alert reader may
notice that this implies the structure is a symmetric edge directed graph.
We are in the process of fitting the graph to the
{@link fluid.tree.SymmetricEdgeDigraphInterface} interface.)
The edges carry analysis information and inherit from
{@link fluid.control.ControlEdge}. The nodes potentially affect analysis
information flowing through them; they inherit from
{@link fluid.control.ControlNode}.  Apart from ports (see below),
all control nodes fall into one of five abstract classes
depending on how many input edges and output edges they have, as
pictorially represented in the following diagram:
<pre>
     			+-@--{@link fluid.control.Flow}--@-+
     		       /      	      \
     {@link fluid.control.Source}---@---{@link fluid.control.Split}	      	       {@link fluid.control.Join}---@---{@link fluid.control.Sink}
		       \      	      /
			+-----@------+
</pre>
(If one needs, say, a three way split, one must use two split nodes.)
The actual class of node determines the semantic action.
For example a {@link fluid.control.Merge} node (inheriting from
{@link fluid.control.Join}) leads to the ``meeting'' of two lattice values in
forward data-flow analysis.
For a complete list of nodes other than ports, see 
<a href="#node-types">below</a>.</p>

<p> This package includes the capability to place two or more independent
flows on the same edge.  For example a {@link fluid.control.TrackedMerge}
node can be used to join two control flows into a single edge.
Later in the graph, a {@link fluid.control.TrackedDemerge} node can be used to
separate them.  A good example of using this for Java is for
<tt>finally</tt> clauses of <tt>throw</tt> statements: no matter
whether the try clause terminates normally or abruptly, the
<tt>finally</tt> clause is always executed.  Rather than copy the
finally clause for the two flows, or worse, to merge them, the
control-flow graph gives each an independent flow of control through
the finally clause.  When the clause terminates, the flows are
separated again.  The ability to have independent flows on a single
edge is also used to separate exception throws from control-flow
caused by <tt>break</tt> or <tt>continue</tt>.  Internally each flow
is named by a sequence (see {@link fluid.control.LabelList}) of control-flow
<em>labels</em> (see {@link fluid.control.ControlLabel}). </p>

<h3>Constructing the Control-Flow Graph</h3>

<p> The control-flow graph is highly structured, following the
abstract syntax of the program.  Each abstract syntax node has an
associate control flow component (see {@link fluid.control.Component}).  All
control flow enters or leaves a component only through a fixed
number of ports (see {@link fluid.control.Port}).  That means even
control flow caused by thrown exceptions or method returns must be
directed through some port.  Each component has three ports, each of
a different type: <dl>
<dt> {@link fluid.control.EntryPort} 
	<dd> Control flow enters here.
<dt> {@link fluid.control.NormalExitPort} 
	<dd> Normal control-flow exits here.
<dt> {@link fluid.control.AbruptExitPort}
	<dd> Abrupt termination (exceptions and non-local control
	flow) uses this port. </dl>
</p>

<p> The control-flow graph is constructed by associating a fixed
control-flow component with every syntax node participating in
control-flow.  The association is carried out by an instance of
{@link fluid.control.ComponentFactory}.
If a node has children which participate in control
flow, then its component includes <em>subcomponents</em> (see
{@link fluid.control.Subcomponent}) which are in essence holes in the
control-flow graph.  The subcomponent has ports that correspond to
the ports of the component for the corresponding child.  The
ports of the subcomponent are never directly connected to the ports of
the component of the child.  Instead, the connection is computed whenever
analysis comes up to a port.  For instance, if analysis
follows control-flow out through a port of a subcomponent, the appropriate
child node of the current node is found and its component determined.
Then analysis continues with the appropriate port of this component.
This all happens invisibly to individual analyses.
This indirection enables the control-flow graph to be up-to-date at
all times.
</p>

<p> Handling nodes with a varying number of children is more
difficult.  All the children are linked together with a certain number
of edges (specified by the component).  The component (which must be
an instance of the class {@link fluid.control.VariableComponent}) also determines
how control-flow enters and leaves the sequence and 
for every child how the sequence edges connect up to its ports (or
not). </p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p> <a name="node-types"></a>Here is a listing of all node types
except for ports: <dl>
<dt>{@link fluid.control.Source}<dd><ul>
	<li> {@link fluid.control.Never} - control never flows from here
	<li> {@link fluid.control.ComponentSource} 
		- control comes from a language specific place</ul>
<dt>{@link fluid.control.Sink}<dd><ul>
	<li> {@link fluid.control.Abort} - control never goes here (we hope)
	<li> {@link fluid.control.ComponentSink}
		- control goes to a language specific place</ul>
<dt>{@link fluid.control.Flow}<dd><ul>
	<li> {@link fluid.control.NoOperation} - control simply flows through
	<li> {@link fluid.control.AddLabel} 
		- generate new longer label list for following edge
	<li> {@link fluid.control.PendingLabelStrip}
		- return to shorter label list for following edge
	<li> {@link fluid.control.ComponentFlow}
		- language specific changes to analysis information</ul>
<dt>{@link fluid.control.Split}<dd><ul>
	<li> {@link fluid.control.Fork} 
		- control flow goes both ways (unused)
	<li> {@link fluid.control.TrackedDemerge}
		- split independent flows merged with <tt>TrackedMerge</tt>
	<li> {@link fluid.control.LabelTest}
		- split independent flows according to some condition
		on the labels.
	<li> {@link fluid.control.Choice}
		- split control flow according to some condition (unused)
	<li> {@link fluid.control.ComponentChoice}
		- split control-flow according to a language-specific
		condition. </ul>
<dt>{@link fluid.control.Join}<dd><ul>
	<li> {@link fluid.control.Merge}
		- control flow comes from both places
	<li> {@link fluid.control.TrackedMerge}
		- merge independent control flows.</ul>
</dl>
See {@link fluid.control.Port} for a breakdown of the various port classes.

<h2>Control-Flow Analysis</h2>

<p> This package also includes control-flow analysis template classes.
The basic worklisting algorithm is specified in the abstract class
{@link fluid.control.FlowAnalysis}.  This class is refined in
{@link fluid.control.ForwardAnalysis} and {@link fluid.control.BackwardAnalysis}.
These two classes must be parameterized by classes implementing
{@link fluid.control.ForwardTransfer} and {@link fluid.control.BackwardTransfer}
respectively.  The transfer classes implement the language-specific
actions.  All other details are handled by these generic classes:
ports, components, and labels.  We will discuss only labels here.
</p>

<p>An edge can have a different control-flow analysis value for any
sequence of labels.  These sequences are affected by only three
control-flow nodes: {@link fluid.control.AddLabel}, {@link fluid.control.LabelTest},
and {@link fluid.control.PendingLabelStrip}.  The sequence is treated as a
stack: we only make changes to the front, adding or removing the first
label.  During analysis, the actual effect on the sequence is determined
by the direction of analysis (forward or backward) and by language
specific actions (as we shall see): <dl>
<dt>AddLabel (push)<dd><dl>
	<dt>forward<dd>
		Prepend the specified label to the sequence.
	<dt>backward<dd>
		See if the first label of the sequence
		<em>overlaps</em> the specific label.
		In other words, see if the first label could have been
		added at this point.  It is not a simple case of
		equality, because of cases where we don't know
		precisely the exception thrown of what abrupt
		termination condition we are looking for (see use
		of <tt>UnknownControlLabel</tt> in the discussion
		of <tt>PendingLabelStrip</tt>).
		The method <tt>testAddLabel</tt> in
		{@link fluid.control.BackwardTransfer} does this operation.
	</dl>
<dt>LabelTest (if match then pop, continue(1) else continue(2))<dd><dl>
	<dt>forward<dd>
		Check if the first label is one being tested for,
		and also check to see if the first label might <em>not</em>
		be the one tested for.  If cases of uncertainty, we
		may end up trying both ways.
		The method <tt>transferLabelTest</tt> does the work here.
	<dt>backward<dd>
		If coming from the `true' side, add the label being
		tested for and continue backwards, otherwise just continue
		backwards.  (This is not as precise as it could be
		in the second case.)
	</dl>
<dt>PendingLabelStrip (swap, if pop then nop else swap, pop endif)<dd><dl>
	<dt>forward<dd>
		Remove and save the first label.
		Remove the next label, which must be a tracking label, if<dl>
		<dt>true<dd>put back saved label
		<dt>false<dd>drop next label and put back saved label</dl>
	<dt>backward<dd>
		Remove and save the first label.
		Then generate two label lists for the incoming edge:<ol>
		<li> One that adds the true tracking label and then
		     adds the saved label
		<li> One that adds an unknown label, then the false
		     tracking label and then the saved label</ol>
	</dl>
This node is only used with {@link fluid.control.TrackedMerge} and
{@link fluid.control.TrackedDemerge} nodes.  It is a complex operation, that
perhaps should be expressed using more nodes, but doing so would simply
result in a larger graph.
