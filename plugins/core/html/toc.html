<h2>Stakeholder goals</h2>

The OpenOME is an <em>assistant</em> to a <b>requirements engineer</b> using
a goal-oriented and agent-oriented modeling language: <b>stakeholder</b>
requirements are modelled as the strategic dependencies and rationale.
<b>Business analysts</b> can model the business requirements into the 
stategic model. In software business, <b>potential users</b> can express their
early requirements into a concise form; <b>software developers</b> can verify the 
design alternatives against the early requirements using the explicit design rationale to 
detect faults at a very early stage; <b>Software testers</b> and <b> quality analysts</b> 
can validate the end-product against the early requirements to see whether it can be released 
with good-enough quality. 
<b>Researchers</b> on requirements engineering can share their understanding
of functional and non-functional requirements and publish the results
in high quality that are accessible by the <b>peer reviewers</b>.

<h2>System requirements</h2>
<pre>
Hardware requirements:
   A desktop or laptop workstation
Software requirements:
   Operating system: Windows 2000/XP, Linux
   Programming language: Java runtime 1.5x
