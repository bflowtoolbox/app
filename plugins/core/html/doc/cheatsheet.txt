============================ setup SDK
download and extract
  eclipse sdk 3.1 => ECLIPSE_HOME
  jre 1.5.0_04  => JAVA_HOME
  openome sdk 0.14 => OME_HOME

move JAVA_HOME to ECLIPSE_HOME/jre
  to make sure eclipse runs with the recent JRE

Run eclipse with the workspace at
  OME_HOME/workspaces/OpenOME

The projects in the workspace are shown in this order:
  captainfeature
  doc
  GR-tool
  ome4eclipse
  ome4eclipse.feature
  OpenOME
  png
  protege_querytab
  q7
  update.ome4eclipse

As we discussed before, not all these projects are relevant
to all developers. 

For OME development:
   OpenOME
   q7
   png
   GR-tool
   captainfeature

For OME/protege development
   protege_querytab

For OME/Eclipse development
   ome4eclipse             => plugin
   ome4eclipse.features    => feature
   update.ome4eclipse      => update site

Every project has similar structure:
   .project => project descriptions
   .classpath => class paths
   build.xml => ant build script
   src/   => source code
   bin/   => class files
   .cvsignore => ignore patterns for cvs sync
   plugin.xml => plugin description
   feature.xml => feature description
   site.xml => update site description

========================== CVS
   
If there is any change to commit to the cvs,
the student need to apply a unix name at the sourceforge.net
then let me know.
I will add the name to the developer list of the openome project
at sourceforge.
You can also apply one and I will assign the admin rights to you
so that  you can also add the unix name of future students.

Now, suppose the unix name is "linda", then you can open the
"CVS repository" perspective in the running Eclipse.

"New a location" with following parameters (through a wizard):
 :extssh:linda@cvs.sf.net:/cvsroot/openome
 :pserver:linda@cvs.sf.net:/cvsroot/openome
The first one is for developer, with commit rights;
the second one is for viewer, with read only rights.

After that is done, you will be able check out projects.

Note. The workspace of the sdk package contains two example repository
with my unix name (yijunsf) associated.

Once that is done, in the "Java" perspective, at the package explorer, you will
be able to right click at any item that is in sync with the cvs repository, and
choose "Team" sub menu to apply cvs commands through various wizards.
