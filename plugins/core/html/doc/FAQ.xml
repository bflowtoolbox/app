How to create a new Telos (GRL, i*, ER, vgraph) Model?
How to create an empty Telos (GRL, i*, ER, v) graph?

<A>
1. The Meta-Models are expressed in Telos. They are stored in the
   directory specified by the system property: "java.libary.path",
   that is:	plugins/edu.toronto.cs.ome, where the components
   such as OpenOME.jar resides. All the files "*.tel" are treated
   as a metamodel, or templates, for the new models.
   
2. In File/New menu command, a dialog prompts for the name of metamodel
   by a list of checkboxes.
   Since some of these metamodels have overlapped class definitions,
   usually we use one of these metamodels. However, since the
   metamodel can be splitted into multiple files, it is possible to
   merge them by checking multiple files.

3. After the metamodel(s) is (are) checked, a SaveFile dialog prompts
   for the name of the Telos model. 
   Entering the name of the Telos model.
   The resulting Telos model is initially exactly the same as the 
   selected metamodels.
   It will be loaded into the editor.

Note 1. On the terms. Here we use "metamodel", "template" and "frameworks" 
as synonyms, regarding the Telos files in the library directory.
Because:
(1) the files usually do not have any instance level entities 
    (pure metamodel). Thus the metamodel will be shown as an empty
    graph.
(2) the files usually provides a template for the editor for the models
(3) the files can be merged into reusable knowledge for the extensions
However, one can put non-empty files into the folder if they serve good
purposes. Thus, in the future, we may want to standardize the term as
"template" to be broader.

Note 2. For creating an empty i* graph, one can create an empty Q7 file, 
which will generate an i* metamodel according to the istar.tel template.
