This folder is experimental for security patterns using ATL.
======================================================   
System Requirements
   + You need to download the ATL Bundle.
     and Place it under a folder, 
         e.g. /IDE/atl/ATLBundle-20080109
   + Create the "links" folder of your openome
     and add a file "atl.link" with the following line:
path=/IDE/atl/ATLBundle-20080109
   + restart the openome launcher   
======================================================   

security.atl transforms an instance of the openome_model.ecore
by applying a security pattern. 

To use the example, you need to first modify the .project
description of Examples, to include the following buildSpec
(You need to switch to the Resource perspective to be able
to edit the file):

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<projectDescription>
	<name>Examples</name>
	<comment></comment>
	<projects>
	</projects>
	<buildSpec>
		<buildCommand>
			<name>org.atl.eclipse.adt.builder.atlBuilder</name>
			<arguments>
			</arguments>
		</buildCommand>
	</buildSpec>
	<natures>
		<nature>org.atl.eclipse.adt.builder.atlNature</nature>
	</natures>
</projectDescription>

After refresh the project, you will get a compiled file 
"security.asm".

Then right click at the openome_model.ecore file to register the 
metamodel.

Finally, create a new Run As dialog to run the project as a new ATL transformation.
Inside the dialog, fill in the following parameters:

Configuration name: New Configuration
Project Name: Example
ATL file: security.atl
F:  /Examples/openome_model/pattern/openome_model.ecore
G: /Examples/openome_model/pattern/openome_model.ecore
IN: /Examples/openome_model/pattern/openaccount.oom 
OUT: /Examples/openome_model/pattern/openaccount-after.oom

Apply the transformation, you will obtain the openaccount-after.oom
as a result.
